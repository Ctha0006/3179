              A work-related fatality is defined as any of the following:	
              <br>
              1. the death of any person where the death occurs: at a workplace or	
              arising from the conduct of the undertaking of an employer/manager;
              and where the person was owed a duty under the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 by an employer or management
              <br>2. the death of a worker, within the meaning of the Workplace Injury Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2013 (WIRC Act)
              <br>3. the death of an employer or self-employed person
              <br> which WorkSafe Victoria has been notified.
              <br><br>There were 66 recorded worker fatalities in 2022. This is the lowest of recorded in 3 years. 
              There has generally been no change in the number of recorded fatalities each year apart from 
              an increase of 27 fatalities from 2018 to 2019. The highest number of work-related injury 
              fatalities in a month was 12 fatalities in April 2019 and March of 2021. 
              <br><br>
              In 2022, the average fatalities slightly decreased from a previous 6.75 to 5.5 fatalities per 
              month. 2018 had the smallest average of 4.4. This may be due to missing data or not all 
              fatalities being recorded.

            <p>Lives lost in Victorian workplaces recorded by <b>WorkSafe Victoria</b> previously excluded 
              some work-related deaths that were not attributable to obligations under the 
              Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004, such as those caused by transport accidents or 
              occupational diseases.
              <br><br>
              From July 2020 this was changed and workers who die on the road, suicides attributable to work,

              It is interesting to note that these 4 industries mentioned had fatalities every year from 2018 to 
              2022, in addition to <b>Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing</b> and <b>Wholesale Trade</b> which had

              It is understandable to see more fatalities in such industries in comparison to 
              <b>Information Media and Telecommunications</b> or <b>Rental, Hiring and Real Estate Services</b>
              which are not physical labour. Mining did not have any recorded fatalities until 2021.
